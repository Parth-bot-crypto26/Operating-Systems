### Operating Systems Notes & Code
This repository contains my personal notes, code practices, and projects from the Operating Systems course. It's designed as a comprehensive resource to help solidify my understanding of fundamental OS concepts and serve as a quick reference for others.

### **Topics Covered**
The notes and code within this repository cover a wide range of topics essential to understanding modern operating systems. You'll find materials on:

* Introduction to Operating Systems

* Processes and Threads

* CPU Scheduling
